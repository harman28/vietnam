**A note about VBH:**
Vietnam Bagpackers Hostel is the largest chain of hostels in Vietnam, and in many towns it's the only reasonable option (eg. Hue). It's basic, extremely cheap, and also very clean, which is why it's so popular with travellers. Sticking to a chain of hostels also acts as a bit of a reassurance: no matter what time I landed up in a town, or how little cash I had on me at the time, or whether I had enough battery in my phone to let me look for hostels, I could usually just show my VBH wristband to a local guy and he'd help me get to the hostel. The hostel staff is also usually very helpful with advice about planning your days, so it's a good place to meet people and make groups to explore things together. I ended up staying at VBH in 4 different towns.
There are some downsides though. VBH does 'activities' every evening in the hostel, many involving free beer, long happy hours, and stupid drinking games with random expats, and so if you don't push yourself, you'll find yourself spending a lot more time in the hostel than you actually should if you want to do a good job exploring Vietnam. This was especially true in Hoi An, where VBH has opened a massive hostel with hotel-like facilities, including multiple pools, lounges, etc. But the hostel is a long way from Hoi An's old quarter, which is really where you _should_ be spending your evenings (it's beautiful), instead of drinking beer with random Swedish people and ordering burgers and pizza. On that note, the food at most VBHs is a crime in itself. It's not bad, it's just decidedly not local, and probably the most disproportionately expensive food you'll eat in Vietnam. Breakfasts were free at VBH, but after a few days I realized I was missing out on exploration time, so started ditching the free breakfast in favour of stepping out and eating whatever looked most interesting on the street.

Cities:

**Hanoi:** This city is basically endless. I ended up spending 4 nights here in what was otherwise a very fast paced trip, and I feel like I could've easily spent a few more. There's that much to do and that much to eat. Will give city specific recommendations for things to do if you ask, but basically assume that extra days in Hanoi are never wasted days. Old quarter alone can consume 3 days.
*Stuff:*
- Make sure you get at least one weekend night here. The area around the lake is shut down for traffic and people come out and do random performances on the road. Early in the evening it's a bit loud and karaoke-y, but later on it settles into a quieter sort of activity, which is nice. 
- People will tell you to go to The Note Coffee for your egg coffee. Do not. Go to Giang Coffee for that instead. Then go to The Note anyway, it's a great place, you'll find out why the second you walk in.
- Have a Banh Mi approx every 6 hours.
- For breakfast, step out early and go to one those local places on the pavements. Your metric should be that you don’t spot any firangs there. Most restaurants in Hanoi have an usher outside urging you to come in, so find one that doesn’t. The breakfast you have in a place like that is guaranteed to be better than anywhere else. I went to a place at 16 Dao Duy Tu street, that’s too small to show up on Google Maps, but was brilliant. However, there are likely dozens like it, so you can easily find more.
- There’s a jazz club called Binh Minh, at the edge of the old quarter, which I discovered only on my last day in Hanoi. I’m glad I didn’t discover it sooner, or I might’ve spent every single evening there.
- There's a restaurant called Highway 4 where you can eat roasted crickets and locusts. For your non veg friends.
- There's a window in the wall called 'Giang - Bun Oc Pho Co', with a really tiny photograph stuck above the window. If you look closely, it's a picture of Anthony Bourdain eating Bun Oc at that restaurant. Accidental discovery that I'm quite proud of.

**Ninh Binh:** A town I've not seen very often in other people's Vietnam itinerary, but one of my favourite places. Ninh Binh is a 2 hour train ride away from Hanoi, so I ended up doing it as a day trip, and was back by 8pm. However, people with time do spend much longer there. Some people I met suggested 2 nights, but I think one is enough.
*Stuff:*
- Ninh Binh itself has nothing in it to do, but it's near two villages/areas, namely Tam Coc and Trang An. Both have temples and ruins, neither of which I cared very much for. Both also have completely insane boat rides, and that's the main attraction. Do an image search of the names to see what I mean. I only managed to do one of the two boat rides, Tam Coc. If you're staying an extra day, do both. 
- Also, get a bike the second you get off the train. They're cheap, and the rides around Ninh Binh are some of the best in Vietnam. In particular, when going from Tam Coc or Ninh Binh to Hoa Lu (ancient capital, more timepass ruins), completely ignore the Google Maps recommended route and try and go by the one that's closer to the hills. The former is just a highway, the latter is a strong contender for best road in Vietnam.

**Ha Long Bay:** I did a one night cruise, and I was quite happy with what it included and what we got to do. However, I met a bunch of people on the boat who were on their second night, and they were pretty happy too, not having gotten bored of the limited activities on the cruise. So I think 2 night cruises are fine. Regarding the cruise company itself, there are a handful of companies that do Bai Tu Long too, and this is mostly what you'll end up picking by default if you stay at decent hostels in Hanoi. I can personally vouch for one called the Christina Cruise, but like I said there are a few more that are probably good. Also, the price differences between different cruises by the same company are often small, and they only affect the luxury of your lodging on the boat, and maybe the food (a bit). It doesn't actually affect your itinerary. 
(Since you're doing South to North, I'd actually recommend doing one of the higher end cruises. It'll be like $10-$15 extra, but a nice, comfortable bed and luxurious personal shower will be a godsend after a staying at hostels of varying quality for 2 weeks)
*Stuff:*
- Buses from Hanoi to Ha Long do a rest stop at this absurd supersupermarket that sells everything from coffee to carpets to marble statues. Everything costs a lot there. Don't buy anything there, it's all cheaper in Hanoi.

**Hue**: I got here by train from Hanoi. It's cheap, and I slept very well. Hue itself doesn't have a whole lot to do, and I wouldn't dream of spending 3 nights there. 1 maybe.
*Stuff:*
- There's an Imperial Palace, and maybe a few other things to go and see. If you're really going to spend that much time there, then that probably means you're going to go to the DMZ and surrounding areas. I don't know very much about that stuff.
- You're very likely going to stay at VBH there. The same street has a few nice restaurants, including Jalapeno and Big Tuna (or something). Hue's noodle soup is called Bun Bo Hue, and it's nice everywhere. I also spotted some nice cafes around.
- Most people you meet in Hue are only there to do one thing: stop, rest, rent a bike, and ride to Da Nang/Hoi An, via Hai Van Pass. People usually send their bags with a truck/van provided by the same company that is renting out the bikes. Can vouch for a company called Motovina for bike rentals, very professional. Don't get tempted by cheaper prices offered by dudes on the road. 
- In fact don't buy anything from dudes on the road. If you need a raincoat, go to the local market. If you need weed, wait till Hoi An.

**Da Nang:** Didn't spend any time here at all, seems to be a regular city. Used the airport, it's the easiest way to head South, and fastest to head North.

**Hoi An:** How long you spend here depends on how much you're enjoying the place. Would recommend you keep this flexible, even if the rest of the trip is fixed. You may find yourself wanting to spend longer there.
*Stuff:*
- Hoi An has incredible food everywhere, and while coffee is great everywhere in Vietnam, the cafes here are especially good. Additionally, the Cao Lao. A lot of Vietnamese towns have their own version of noodle soup, and Cao Lao is Hoi An's. It's unique cos the noodles themselves are taste delicious (rather than the beef in other towns), which I mention because it means that the veg version is probably also good. 
- There's also a pure veg place I've forgotten the name of, that looked amazing, that I somehow walked past while trying to explore some smaller alleys. It's called Minh Hien III.
- Hoi An is a shopping town. Everywhere you walk in the main market, people will come up to you and offer to stitch custom made suits and shoes for you. Know that suits can take up to 24 hours after measurements to get delivered, so give them soon if you don't plan on being there long. Shoes take less time, and dress shoes custom made for your foot are a joy nobody ever knows they want until they've tried it.
- Aside from the custom made stuff, there's also tons of other ready-made sports wear, but if you're intending to buy a lot (people do. Guy I was travelling with, Danish, bought 20 T-shirts), I'd recommend buying in Hanoi. The quality is the same, and you don't have to carry around the weight for too many days. (Alternately, you could do what Danish did and pack ultra light for Vietnam, half a rugsack, knowing that midway through the trip you’ll restock on T-shirts.)
- Hoi An is a cycling town. Get a bicycle every morning, even if you’re doing nothing with it. It’s cheap and getting one early means you get good quality.
- I stayed at VBH, and that was a mistake. It's a bit away from the old quarter, and it's really quite top notch in terms of facilities, which are reasons to never leave the hostel. You can spend one night here if you want to see the hype about 'the best VBH party hostel' and meet more people from more countries, but other nights I'd recommend finding a hostel closer to the river.
- Hoi An has tours to My Son sanctuary, which is a bit touristy, but quite nice if you manage to get a not-crowded slot.
- The Banh Mi at Banh Mi Phuong might be the best in Vietnam, but then it's good everywhere so who cares

**Ho Chi Minh City:** I spent very little time here, since I was mostly running out of days, and the people I'd met who were travelling South-to-North didn't speak very highly of it. It was described to me as a great place for clubbing and nightclub. I feel sure this is shortsighted and that there's got to be a lot more to the place, but again, I just didn't get the time.
*Stuff:*
- There's a really great museum that I'm sorry I missed, and some day tours like the war tunnels and the Mekong delta might be interesting. 
- La Bien Street is worth walking on even if you have a nothing more than a few hours. Nice cafes and pubs, although a few too many people attempting to drag you into massage parlours.

**Mui Ne:** I have heard very widely differing opinions about this town. I loved it, and had by far my most interesting day there, but several people didn't and some leave just a few hours after they arrive because they're so disappointed. The primary complaint seems to be "it's too much like Europe", which I didn't really relate to. I would probably go back here, and depending on how the rest of your itinerary is going, you might consider spending 2 nights here.
*Stuff:*
- When you're traveling to the city by bus, the first time the dude calls out 'Mui Ne' is _not_ when you have to get off. That's still about 14km away from the road with the hostels on it. Check maps before disembarking, or shady situations can ensue.
- Somebody somewhere on Reddit drew a 40km bike route on a map of Mui Ne, that goes in and and around the town and covers a bunch of different things. Alongside Ninh Binh, this was one of the incredibly beautiful roads I got to ride on. You've seen those photographs of complete wilderness and a single road that dips down in front of you and then stretches to the horizon? You've see a bunch of them on this route. My experience was particularly memorable because I ran out of petrol midway and had to hitchhike, but the ride was already special before that happened.
- Mui Ne has sand dunes, red and white, that people flock to to try sand sliding or whatever. I got to ride past the dunes on the route above, so I didn't bother with this.
- There's a tourist attraction called Fairy Stream, which I think is a great way to spend an hour if you can go early enough to avoid the crowd. It starts off as effectively a naala, but if you get deep enough it turns into a nice walk that's fun if you're doing it in relative seclusion.
- The VBH hostel there is nice, and it's also one of the most social ones, because so many people are not fond of the town outside it, so they all spend their time around the pool there, chilling and reading. I got stoned with people of 6 different nationalities here, which was exactly as profound as it sounds like it could've been.
- I know this isn't strictly relevant for you, but just in case you're travelling with someone who might benefit from this, the seafood in Mui Ne is genuinely incredible. Perfect intersection of fresh-out-of-the-water and still-cheap-as-fuck. Try everything you have the stomach for.
  - Oysters are basically veg, right YV? They are. I mean you only know they're alive cos your schoolteachers told you they are, which can be said for plants as well. You should have an oyster. With spiced oil and herbs.

**Dalat:** 
*Stuff:*
- Stay at Dalat Family Hostel. Do not question this, just stay there and thank me later. They live up to their name, adopt you like a son, and attempt to force free meals onto you at every opportunity.
- There's something called a 'manual rollercoaster' that goes down a waterfall somewhere in this town, that I enjoyed far more than any adult should. Try and start your ride at least 5 minutes after the person before you, so you don't end up stuck behind some old fellow who refuses to go very fast. Also, don't bother with the return ticket, just do one-way. The ride back is no fun, is usually too crowded, and the alternative walk is nice and crosses 3 waterfalls.
- There's a Korean restaurant called Fungi Chungi in the city center, which was one the nicer 'fine-dine' experiences I had in Vietnam. Korean preparations are elaborate, and it's fun that they cook stuff on the table. The food isn't all cheap, but I guess veg would be.

**General Vietnam Tips**
- Fly out from a different airport. Matlab fly into Hanoi and out from HCMC, or the other way around. If you book a return ticket to the same airport, the air ticket is marginally cheaper, but you'll end up spending more on the domestic flight back to the city you landed in.
- Vietnam has really cool sleeper buses, which you’ll use a fair bit, especially in the South. This should be common sense, but is easily missed I think: If you’re on a bus travelling South, sit on the left side of the bus. If you’re on a bus travelling North, sit on the right. Most highway are coastal, and sea views can be amazing.
- I can't stress this enough, _don't_ plan out the whole thing. Keep it nice and flexible. One of the best things about this trip and this country was that you meet so many bagpackers who are doing essentially the same thing that you are, that you keep adding plans to try out stuff other people say is nice, dropping items from your itinerary if you're advised that they won't work in the current weather, and modifying your dates to spend some more time travelling with the people you've met. At one point, my entire group split up to go off in 3 different directions, i.e. some returned North to try out Mai Chau (relatively new Vietnam destination, great reviews from my friends, I don't know much about it), some carried on South to cover Dalat/Mui Ne, and some just stayed put in Hoi An cos it was great there. So we all did exactly what we wanted to. Hold on to that if you can.
